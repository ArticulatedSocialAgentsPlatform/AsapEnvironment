/**
Environment that is responsible for calling copy() on a set of {@link CopyEmbodiment 
CopyEmbodiments} at appropriate times.

A Player has a plan containing PlanUnits. These PlanUnits operate on an Embodiment. 
At play(t) time, when all current planunits have finished, the result needs to be 
copied to the embodiment. A CopyEnvironment is an environment responsible for 
making sure this copy() is performed.

ANIMATIONENGINE
MotionUnits operate on a VJoint (part of a SkeletonEmbodiment). If the HmiRenderEnvironment 
is used, the copy() action involves calling calculateMatrices(). If rendering is done in Ogre, 
SUIT, etc, the copy() also involves sending the resulting joint configuration to the render
system.

FACEENGINE
FaceUnits operate on a FaceController (part of a FaceEmbodiment). If the HmiRenderEnvironment 
is used (so, a {@link hmi.renderenvironment.HmiRenderBodyAndFaceEmbodiment}), the copy() action involves taking the  
current Mpeg4config and actually applying it to the OpenGL head, and setting the morph targets 
of the graphical body (see {@link hmi.renderenvironment.HmiRenderBodyAndFaceEmbodiment#copy()}. For other environments it may again
involve some UDP or TCPIP communication

A CopyEnvironment is an environment responsible for making sure this copy() is performed.
In a typical HMI setup, HmiRenderEnvironment does this just prior to actually rendering a frame.
If no HmiRenderEnvironment is present, you may e.g. use a ClockDrivenCopyEnvironment that does 
this on the time() of a SystemClock.
